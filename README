This repository contains the configuration files and scripts that I use in
machines that I have access to.

Use and modify them as you wish, I hereby put them in the public domain.

You will also find some external software and plugins (like all the vim
plugins). Of course those are released under the license chosen by the
original developers. You should refer to the respective web sites to obtain
info about the licenses.

Have fun,
